Having explored several datasets (2010-2021) from the <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data">Capital Bikeshare</a> program regarding the use of these bikes, 
our goal in this project page is to pass on our insights into how citizens and tourists use the DC program. Through these findings, 
decisions can be made on where to best place bikes, program passes to offer, and what other cities would most benefit from the introduction 
of the bike share system. We have created geographical mappings of the trips that are taken and a number of different plots showing 
trends related to weather, destinations, and ride duration. Explore the Capital Bikeshare program with our interactive visualizations and make your own discoveries!</p><br/><br/></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#333333" idyll="[object Object]"><div class="idyll-text-container" style="background-color:#333333;color:#ebebeb" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><br/><h2 id="popular-starting-points-and-destinations">Popular Starting Points and Destinations</h2><p>We began our analysis with aggregating the data to count the total number

the neighborhood has been a vital DC community since the late 19th century, and continues to be a hot spot 
for residents and visitors of all ages. An array of unique shops and exciting restaurants 
along Connecticut Avenue, one of the busy streets in the neighborhood, is exciting enough 
to keep you going all day. You’ll also discover dozens of bistros, bars, boutiques and museums throughout this exciting neighborhood.</p><p>15th &amp; P St. SW is within the Dupont neighborhood and just two blocks away from the Dupont Circle itself. </p><h3 id="lincoln-memorial">Lincoln Memorial</h3><p>The iconic memorial built to honor the 16th U.S. president is a must-see for every visitor to the nation’s capital.
The grand Lincoln Memorial towers over the Reflecting Pool, anchoring the western end of the National Mall. 
The best way to approach the memorial is from the east, by the Washington Monument and the National World War II Memorial. 
This will put you at the edge of the Reflecting Pool, a shimmering expanse which best illuminates 
the grand structures honoring our most storied leaders.</p><h3 id="jefferson-dr-&amp;-14-st.-sw">Jefferson Dr &amp; <!-- -->1<!-- -->4 <!-- -->St. SW</h3><p>Located right by the Washington Monument. The Washington monument was Built to honor George Washington,

This pattern is most likely attributed to the high number of tourists visiting DC in the summer. </p><div style="position:center;width:80%;margin-left:10%" idyll="[object Object]"> <br/><img src="./static/images/yellow_months.png" alt="&quot;Monthly&quot;"/><br/></div><h3 id="weather">Weather</h3><p>After exploring the effect of 3 different weather variables on our ride counts, we have found that
temperature has the greatest correalation with bike riding. In the following visualization, we can see that
there is a relataively strong correaltion between temperature and bike counts. We also see that roughly 40% of the variation
in bike counts is explained by changes in temperature, while the other 60% are influenced by other factors.</p><div style="position:center;width:80%;margin-left:10%" idyll="[object Object]"> <br/><img src="./static/images/temp.png" alt="&quot;Temperature&quot;"/><br/></div><h3 id="time-of-day">Time of Day</h3><p>Next, we explore how the time of day effects bike usage. In the following visualziation, we can see
that riding peaks around 8 am and 5 pm. Thus, we can deduce that many people ride to and from work on these bikes!
There is also a slight increase around lunchtime, which further supports this claim, as workers are likely using these
bikes to go out for lunch.</p><div style="position:center;width:80%;margin-left:10%" idyll="[object Object]"> <br/><img src="./static/images/hour.png" alt="&quot;Usage By Hour&quot;"/><br/></div><br/><br/><br/></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div style="background-color:#333333" idyll="[object Object]"><div class="idyll-text-container" style="background-color:#333333;color:#ebebeb" idyll="[object Object]"><br/><br/><h2 id="how-long-are-bikers-renting?">How Long Are Bikers Renting?</h2><h3 id="exploring-the-length-of-rentals">exploring the length of rentals</h3><p>This visualization shows the length of time that bikes have been rented throughout the history of the program. Most rides (over 10 Million) have been shorter than an hour. 
However, there are also a large number of bikers who keep their bikes rented for 24 hours. 
The Capital Bikeshare program has a <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/pricing/day-passes">24-hour pass</a>, 
which is likely the reason that a large number of rides end at around the 24-hour mark, but significantly less rides end after longer rental durations.</p><div style="width:100%"></div><div style="width:100%"></div><br/></div></div></div><div class="fullWidth"><div class="idyll-text-container-light" id="end"><br/><br/><h6 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h6><p>Creators: Nadia Domnina, Nathaniel Marcuson, Olivia Hurd, Frank Wu, Ashina Agarwal</p><p><span>The Capital Bikeshare System Data: <a href="https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data">https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data</a></span><br/><span>benbalter/dc-maps on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/dc-maps">https://github.com/benbalter/dc-maps</a></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
