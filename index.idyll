## Background

Over the last 10 years bike sharing has become more and more popular in big cities, specifically in Washington DC. By exploring several datasets about the DC BikeShare program regarding the use of these bikes, we hope to gain more insight into when and where they are most used. Through these findings, decisions can be made on where to best place  bikes and what other cities would most benefit from the introduction of the bike share system. We plan to create a geographical mapping of the trips being taken in order to give viewers a good sense of which stations are the most popular starting points and destinations. We also plan on making animated time series charts showing the monthly and yearly trends in overall usage, and pairing these trends with weather data

## Popular Starting Points and Destinations

We collected data from the DC BikeShare website on all the bike rides that have happenned between 2010 and 2017. This data included the start and end destinations of each ride. In this section of our analysis, we aggregated the data to count the total number of rides starting and ending at each bike station. With the help of these maps, we can see the most popular origin points and destinations within the capital.

### Starting Points

The following map displays the locations from which bike rides begin.

(It will be much more interesting once the data also includes the station names)

### Destination Points

In contrast, this map displays the locations where bike rides end.(It will be much more interesting once the data also includes the station names)

### Most Popular Routes and their Times

I calculated the most popular routes in 2017. The data is good but the visualization isnt the most descriptive. 
Example: 56th station to 100th station: total rides: 1654, average time: 22 mins. You get the point.
I want to create somthing like this this week!

## Monthly Trends (Not Done)

The following chart shows bike usage over a span of a year.

## Hourly Trends by Day of the Week

It's workdays (blue) and non-workdays (purple), and a pretty expected pattern is shown. Next I'll try to add some interaction and a legend. After I can get this done, and feel semi-okay with d3, I'm gonna try something like this to help us avoid line charts! https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-stacked-bar-chart

^^ This will be so cool looking if you make it animated!!!

## Weather Trends

Will refine this further later. Just wanted to get some weather stuff in.

## Scroller for some static images (unfinished)

Not sure what graphs we can even put here, out of ideas at the moment. But 3-4 different ones would be good, even if its the same graph but with different annotations ,bringing attention to different insights.

This can be moved up to a more relevant section as well

[Scroller className:"hasBackground" currentStep:myLocation]

  [Graphic className:"d3-component-container"]
    [CustomD3Component className:"d3-component" state:`myLocation + 1` /]
  [/Graphic]

  [Step]
    This would be a good place to put some static visualizations. For example, jpg's from Tableau. The scroller makes it more interesting than it is.
